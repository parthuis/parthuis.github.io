After studying both versatile engineering at École Centrale de Nantes (France)
and physics at Technische Universität Darmstadt (Germany), I prepared my PhD
within the Nuclear Physics Department of CEA Paris-Saclay, the French
Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, working with Thomas Duguet
and Jean-Paul Ébran. Right after obtaining my degree from Université
Paris-Saclay in September 2018, I moved to University of Surrey (United Kingdom)
to work within the Nuclear Theory Group with Carlo Barbieri. Since September
2020, I have been a member of the STRONGINT group of Achim Schwenk at the TU
Darmstadt.

My research focuses on developing ab initio many-body methods to study the
structure of finite nuclei, both from a formal and a computational point of
view. My previous work includes the development and first application of
[Bogoliubov Many-Body Perturbation Theory](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01992165),
a low-cost correlated method relying on the concept of symmetry breaking. As
part of this work with diagrammatic methods, I am the maintainer of
[ADG](https://github.com/adgproject/adg/), an open-source Python package
generating diagrams and expressions for several many-body methods.
