After studying both versatile engineering at École Centrale de Nantes (France)
and physics at Technische Universität Darmstadt (Germany), I prepared my PhD
within the Nuclear Physics Department of CEA Paris-Saclay, the French
Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, working with Thomas Duguet
and Jean-Paul Ébran. Right after obtaining my degree from Université
Paris-Saclay in September 2018, I moved to University of Surrey (United Kingdom)
to work within the Nuclear Theory Group with Carlo Barbieri. Since September
2020, I have been a member of the STRONGINT group of Achim Schwenk at the TU
Darmstadt.

My research focuses on developing ab initio many-body methods to study the
structure of finite nuclei, both from a formal and a computational point of
view. My previous works include the development and first application of
[Bogoliubov Many-Body Perturbation Theory](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01992165),
a low-cost correlated method relying on the concept of symmetry breaking.
More recently, I worked on the extension towards heavier nuclei of
Self-Consistent Green's Functions calculations, resulting in the first
*ab initio* [study](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.182501) of charge
radii and densities and neutron skins above the Sn isotopic line. Other efforts
towards calculations of heavy nuclei include reducing the memory requirements
for [storing matrix elements](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2021.136623).
My latest project included the development of [Monte Carlo methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16167)
to tackle infinite matter with non-local interactions.

In particular, one of my interests is the automatisation of the development
process of many-body methods. When designing and implementing a new formalism,
or pushing it towards higher precision, a lot of time is spent on long,
error-prone hand-made derivations and operations. This can be reduced by using
the appropriate tools to let the computer take care of it.
As part of this effort, I am the maintainer and main developer of
[ADG](https://github.com/adgproject/adg/), an open-source Python package
generating diagrams and expressions for several many-body methods. This work
additionally led to progress in our understanding of [many-body diagrammatics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.11.023).
